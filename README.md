# BrickMasterVR

This is a Virtual Reality brick building software which contains almost all of the official [LDraw](https://www.ldraw.org/) parts.

This is the holy grail of my Computer Science career so far. It is the single best thing I have created in my lifetime.

I have worked countless hours on this project, and I will continue developing it in my own time until it is finished.

This project was developed using Unity.
